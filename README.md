# Hand-Gesture-Communication-For-Hearing-Impaired-Using-Machine-Learning
A smart glove using flex sensors, accelerometer, and SVM-based machine learning to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into real-time speech and text. Designed for speech and hearing-impaired users, it enhances communication through a portable, affordable, and interactive wearable system.

##ABSTRACT
Recent advances in technology have brought with them precious solutions to en- hance communication for deaf or mute people. This research aims to enhance com- munication for such people by adopting an automatic speech system. Communica- tion is a basic part of human behavior, and it plays an important role in the way we connect with others. Just imagine how difficult it would be if humans could not speak or hear! The main drive of this project is to aid those who encounter such difficulties by facilitating better interaction with others. Since sign language is not necessarily spoken by everyone everywhere, the system facilitates the disabled to communicate well so that they can express their ideas and requirements. The system has huge potential to contribute to industries like healthcare and education.
Wearable gloves are utilized here as a cheap alternative. There are four flex sen- sors, one accelerometer, one speaker module, gloves, one Arduino Uno microcon- troller, an LCD screen, a GSM 800L module, and one lithium-ion rechargeable bat- tery employed in this system. These create an intelligent sign language acknowl- edgement system for the support of people who are mute. The system employs three rechargeable batteries to supply power to the Arduino Uno, GSM, and speaker mod- ule. The sensors pick up the movement upon a gesture and transform it into a voltage signal. The Arduino Uno processes the signal and displays the respective sign on the LCD screen and verbally speaks out the identified sign via the speaker.
